Storage
=======

The simplest place to store ReStructuredText is on your own computer, of course.
You can merrily save files to a folder deep in ``My Documents`` and go
on your way, perhaps emailing someone a Pandoc-generated PDF from time
to time. But if you want to enjoy the true power of collaborating and
publishing with ReStructuredText, you’ll want to share the files you’re working
on or publish them in another form.


A shared server
---------------

If you are collaborating on documents or contributing to documentation
at work, you might need access to a shared server such as SharePoint or
Samba, WebDAV, or online tools such as a Google Drive account. You can
store your source files there or upload HTML, Word, PDF, and other
documents you create from your ReStructuredText.

Cloud storage
-------------

Cloud storage services like `Box <https://www.box.com>`__,
`DropBox <https://www.dropbox.com/>`__, and
`OneDrive <https://onedrive.live.com>`__ are a great place to keep
documents you want available from everywhere. You can save ReStructuredText
files from one computer and have them available on other devices, even
sharing them with colleagues. 

Web hosting
-----------

If you’re creating online documentation or a website, you’ll need a
place to host it. Web hosting is far too big a subject to cover here,
but you might need to investigate whether you need any of the following:

-  A blog service such as `Wordpress <https://wordpress.com/>`__,
   `Blogger <https://www.blogger.com/>`__, or
   `Medium <https://medium.com/>`__ where you can publish writing
   directly
-  A web host, to present your HTML files as web pages
-  FTP software to upload HTML to a web host
-  Another integrated online publishing service or platform
