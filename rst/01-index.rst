How to do things with ReStructuredText
======================================

ReStructuredText is not just a markup language. It is ...

With shared storage or source control, ReStructuredText can be a powerful
collaboration framework, suitable for both technical and non-technical
contributors and supported by tools that meet every preference.

This guide presents some basic recipes for working with some useful
ReStructuredText tools. Each recipe lists what you’ll need. Read `Getting
started <getting-started/getting-started/>`__ to learn how to get set
up.

If you want to know more about the available tools first, you can browse
these sections:

-  `Source control with Git <../tools/tools-git/>`__.

Consider installing more than one ReStructuredText editor to see which features
you like.

About the recipes
-----------------

Each recipe explains the goals, “ingredients,” and procedures for an
interesting way to use ReStructuredText. Just as a lasagna recipe doesn’t
contain instructions for preheating (or installing) the oven, the
recipes in this guide don’t contain software installation instructions.
Git commands are not repeated from recipe to recipe, but documented more
centrally to keep the recipes short.

The idea is to help you get started and work around some of the less
obvious “gotchas”—not to provide complete documentation. You might find
it helpful to open each tool’s website as you try the recipes, in case
you get stuck.

Some recipes go together. You might use `Centralized Git
workflow <../recipes/recipes-centralized-workflow/>`__ to manage content
you are editing in a ??? `Git wiki <../recipes/recipes-git-wiki/>`__ with
the goal of `publishing a website with
Hugo <../recipes/recipes-hugo/>`__. Or you might take content that you
started by `taking notes <../recipes/recipes-notes/>`__ and turn it into
a `slide presentation <../recipes/recipes-slides-remark/>`__.
