Getting started
===============

You can start working with ReStructuredText just by opening your favorite text
editor and starting to type—but you probably want to do more than that.
For example, you might want to share information on a website or wiki,
take notes, or publish an eBook. To get the most out of ReStructuredText, you’ll
want to be familiar with some of these tools and topics.

Ingredients
-----------

These are the tools and resources you will use for the recipes in this
guide. Each recipe lists the tools you’ll need.

A ReStructuredText editor is a specialized text editor that works with ReStructuredText.
Different editors have different features—you’ll want to play with more
than one to find out which you like.

Pandoc

Pandoc enables your ReStructuredText editor to import and export in several
formats and also has a few tricks of its own. I recommend Pandoc for
anyone who works with ReStructuredText.

If you are collaborating with others, you’ll need a shared place to
store ReStructuredText files. You might also want web hosting or a blogging
platform where you can publish your content when it’s complete.

Source control can be very important for collaborating without
catastrophe. You’ll need an account with a Git host, a Git client, and
Git installed on your computer.

Documentation management tools, static site generators, and even Pandoc
can be useful to convert your content to a final format for general
consumption.

You can install everything up front, or just install what you need as
you go along. If you’re not sure, start with the following steps:

1. Install `Pandoc <../../tools/tools-publishing/#pandoc>`__.
2. Choose and install a `ReStructuredText
   editor <../../tools/tools-editors/>`__.
3. Set up `Git <../../tools/tools-git-setup/>`__.

!!! hint Some editors detect pandoc, so installing it first is a good
idea.

Once you’ve got these tools installed, you can start trying the recipes.

Things to know
--------------

You’ll find it easiest to follow the recipes in this guide if you are
comfortable with the following topics:

| **ReStructuredText Syntax**
| Although some editors provide a WYSIWYG experience, knowing how to
  write `ReStructuredText <>`__
  directly will help you work more quickly and easily with a wider
  variety of tools.

-  See the `ReStructuredText
   cheatsheet <>`__



| **Working with a package manager**
| Installing some tools requires using one of the following common
  package managers:

-  Linux: `apt-get <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto>`__
   or `yum <http://yum.baseurl.org/>`__
-  macOS: `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__
-  Windows: `Chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/>`__

A package manager can make it easy to install several packages at once.
For example:

::

   sudo apt-get install python3 ghostwriter pandoc mkdocs hugo gftp

| **Git**
| Some of the recipes in this guide use `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__.
  Git is very powerful, but doesn’t have to be hard to use. The recipes
  in this guide emphasize simplicity. If you already know Git, you can
  choose to do things differently. If you don’t know git, take a look at
  `Git basics <../getting-started-git-basics>`__.
