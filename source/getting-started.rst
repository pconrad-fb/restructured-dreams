Getting started
===============

You can start working with reStructuredText just by opening your favorite text
editor and starting to type—but you probably want to do more than that.
For example, you might want to share information on a website or wiki,
take notes, or publish an eBook. To get the most out of ReStructuredText, you’ll
want to be familiar with some of these tools and topics.

Ingredients
-----------

These are the tools and resources you will use for the recipes in this
guide. Each recipe lists the tools you’ll need.

**Editor**

A reStructuredText editor is a specialized text editor that makes it easier to get
the syntax right. Some code editors and text Editors include tools for working
with reStructuredText.  Different editors have different features—you’ll want to play
with more than one to find out which you like.

**Pandoc**

Pandoc lets you convert between reStructuredText and a few other formats.

**Shared storage**

If you are collaborating with others, you’ll need a shared place to
store reStructuredText files. You might also want web hosting or a blogging
platform where you can publish your content when it’s complete.

**Git**

Source control can be very important for collaborating without
catastrophe. You’ll need an account with a Git host, a Git client, and
Git installed on your computer. Some code editors include their own Git client,
which makes it easy to manage your files and changes.

**Sphinx**

Sphinx is a documentation generator or a tool that translates a set of plain text
source files into various output formats, automatically producing cross-references,
indices, etc. That is, if you have a directory containing a bunch of reStructuredText
or Markdown documents, Sphinx can generate a series of HTML files, a PDF file
(via LaTeX), man pages and much more.

Getting started
---------------

You can install everything up front, or just install what you need as
you go along. If you’re not sure, start with the following steps:

#. Install **Pandoc**.
#. Install **Python**.
#. Choose and install a **reStructuredText editor** or a **code editor**.
#. Set up **Git**.
#. Install **Sphinx**.

Once you’ve got these tools installed, you can start trying the recipes.

Things to know
--------------

You’ll find it easiest to follow the recipes in this guide if you are
comfortable with the following topics.

**The command line**

Some of the recipes in this guide involve at least some typing on the command
line. You'll definitely need to use the command line a little bit when you're
working with Pandoc or Sphinx, for example.

**Working with a package manager**

Some tools require installation using one of the following common
package managers:

-  Linux: `apt-get <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto>`__
   or `yum <http://yum.baseurl.org/>`__
-  macOS: `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__
-  Windows: `Chocolatey <https://chocolatey.org/>`__

A package manager can make it easy to install several packages at once.

**Installing Python apps with Pip**

You don't need to be a Python programmer, but having the ability to install python
apps with the ``pip`` or ``pip3`` command is helpful because some editors and site generators are Python-based.

**Git**

Some of the recipes in this guide use `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__.
Git is very powerful, but doesn’t have to be hard to use. The recipes
in this guide emphasize simplicity. If you already know Git, you can
choose to do things differently. If you don’t know git, take a look at
`Git basics <../getting-started-git-basics>`__.

**Other documentation tools**

You can use reStructuredText to produce websites, blog posts, books, and even
a wiki. You should know something about Acrobat, Google Drive, HTML, Microsoft
Office, and other tools you might use to work with content originally written in
reStructuredText.
