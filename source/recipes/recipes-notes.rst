Take notes

Tp-Note is a note-taking-tool and a template system - freely available for Windows, MacOS and Linux - that consistently synchronizes the note’s meta-data with its filename. If you like to keep your notes next to your files and you care about expressive filenames, then Tp-Note might be the tool of your choice. Tp-Note collects various information about its environment and the clipboard and stores them in variables. New notes are created by filling these variables in predefined and customizable Tera-templates. TP-Note’s default templates are written in Markdown and can be easily adapted to any other markup language if needed. By default, TP-Note launches the system file-editor (or any other of your choice, e.g. MarkText or Typora) after creating a new note. 

But you can also just use ReText or Formiko

Atom, Sublime, VScode might give a better UI with the directory/file nav on the left.
