Create an ePub book
===================

You can use Pandoc to create an ePub book suitable for tablets and
phones or for self-publishing on
`Amazon <https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/bookshelf>`__.


There's also https://github.com/mattharrison/rst2epub2

    a binary, rst2epub, to convert rst files into epub2 compliant files (ie that pass epub check, can be loaded into Apple, BN, Kobo, etc. Or converted to mobi and thrown into AMZN)
    a library, epublib, that has the ability to programatically create epub files. See the test function in epublib/epub.py for more details. There is experimental support for KF8 fixed layout as well.


And Sphinx
