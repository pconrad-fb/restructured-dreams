Editors

Like other markup languages, reStructuredText works well with text editors and code editors, and a small number of purpose-built editors. Here are a few to look at.

Code editors
------------
Code editors, while they are not designed specifically for reStructuredText, sometimes offer sophisticated packages to support reStructuredText editing and preview.

An advantage of a code editor is the ability to do things like jump to a specific line number or set text wrapping rules. A disadvantage is that code editors might not have packages to help you edit tables graphically. Some editors let you manage your project in Git directly from the user interface. The following editors, among others, are worth a look:

- `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_
- `Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_
- `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_

There are also various reStructuredText tools for `Eclipse <https://www.eclipse.org/>`_.

reStructuredText editors
------------------------

There are a few dedicated reStructuredText editors out there. Most editors offer a live preview with error messages to help you troubleshoot your reStructuredText as you write. My current favorite is ReText, which is simple but makes tables and images easy. An advantage of a dedicated reStructuredText editor is that some of them include support for editing tables and other syntactical features.

Formiko
^^^^^^^

`Formiko <https://github.com/ondratu/formiko#readme>`_ is a simple, capable editor that works with both reStructuredText and Markdown. It is no-frills, offering a few controls and preferences but not much more.

ReText
^^^^^^

`ReText <https://github.com/retext-project/retext/blob/master/README.md>`_ is a Markdown,  reStructuredText, and Textile editor with a few frills, including menu commands to help with tables and images.

Online editors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Online reStructuredText editor <http://rst.ninjs.org/#>`_
* `Online Sphinx Editor <https://livesphinx.herokuapp.com/>`_
* `reStructuredText Viewer <http://rst.aaroniles.net/>`_



Text editors
------------
Because reStructuredText is just plain text, even the simplest text editor can be a capable tool. Some well-established text editors offer reStructuredText support:

- `BbEdit <https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/bb>`_
- `Emacs <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/>`_
- `JEdit <http://www.jedit.org/>`_
- `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_
- `Vim <https://www.vim.org/>`_
