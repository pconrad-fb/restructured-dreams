Like other markup languages, reStructuredText offers simple syntax for inline markup
(emphasis, for example) and headings. *Interpreted
text roles* and *explicit markup,* which includes *directives* are general extension mechanisms
for marking up phrases and text blocks. In turn, interpreted text and Explicit
markup provide the bases for links, tables, images, and a number of useful built-in
directives.

This guide shows the basics of some of the available features of reStructuredText,
but doesn't provide a full reference. The intention of this document is
to give you a good overall understanding of reStructuredText before you try the recipes
later in the book.
