reStructuredText Syntax
=======================

We have

* Basics - inline markup, headings
* Interpreted text
* Explicit markup and directives
* Links
* Tables
* Images
* Other useful directives

And then we'll talk about some o fthe things that use some of these things together, like admonitions.

We might not cover everything. There's more to explore.

This guide shows the basics of some of the available features of reStructuredText, but does not provide a full reference. The intention of this document is to provide an understanding of how reStructuredText works and an introduction to some of the most interesting features, so that you can try the recipes in the rest of the book.
