How to do things with ReStructuredText
======================================

reStructuredText is a powerful markup language originally designed for documenting
Python code. With shared storage or source control, reStructuredText can be a powerful
collaboration framework, suitable for both technical and non-technical
contributors and supported by a few editors and other tools.

This guide presents some basic recipes for working with
reStructuredText tools. Each recipe lists what you’ll need. Read `Getting
started <getting-started>`__ to learn how to get set
up.

About the recipes
-----------------

Each recipe explains the goals, “ingredients,” and procedures for an
interesting way to use reStructuredText. Just as a lasagna recipe doesn’t
contain instructions for preheating (or installing) the oven, the
recipes in this guide don’t contain software installation instructions.
Git commands are not repeated from recipe to recipe, but documented more
centrally to keep the recipes short.

The idea is to help you get started and work around some of the less
obvious “gotchas”—not to provide complete documentation. You might find
it helpful to open each tool’s website as you try the recipes, in case
you get stuck.

Some recipes go together. You might use Centralized Git
workflow to manage content you are editing in a Git wiki with
the goal of publishing a website with
Sphinx. Or you might take content that you
started by taking notes and turn it into
a slide presentation.
